      <h2 class="m-t-none m-b-md">Privacy Policy</h2>
      <h3 class="m-t-none m-b-md">Introduction</h3>
      <p>
        BeKind partners with schools, teachers, and students to promote positive behaviour and
        wellbeing. We value the trust that school communities place in us, and we are committed to
        working in a transparent, ethical, responsible, and secure manner.
      </p>
      <p>
        BeKind complies with relevant Australian privacy laws, including the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth),
        the Australian Privacy Principles, and applicable Department of Education privacy policies
        and guidelines.
      </p>
      <p>
        We are committed to protecting personal information and being clear about what we collect,
        how we use it, and the choices schools and families have. This applies whether you are a
        student, teacher, parent/carer, or a visitor to our website or digital platforms.
      </p>
      <p>
        This policy explains how we collect, use, store, and disclose personal information provided
        to us online, in person, through digital sign-ups, or via school-managed systems. It also
        outlines how we handle information obtained from third parties when relevant (for example,
        school administration systems or Department of Education platforms).
      </p>
      <p>
        If you engage with BeKind—through our website, digital resources, learning activities, or
        school programs—we will make this policy available so you understand how your information is
        handled.
      </p>
