      <h3 class="m-t-lg m-b-md">What is the BeKind program?</h3>
      <p>
        BeKind is a school-based wellbeing and kindness initiative designed to help students grow in
        empathy, social responsibility, and positive behaviour through simple, practical acts of
        kindness.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each week, students focus on a specific “Act of Kindness” such as speaking encouragement,
        listening well, helping others, or honouring local heroes. Teachers introduce the theme
        through lessons and activities, and students put kindness into action within their school
        and community.
      </p>
      <p>
        Schools receive access to a digital portal where teachers can track participation, celebrate
        progress, and view reflections or stories shared by students (teacher-moderated).
      </p>

      <h3 class="m-t-lg m-b-md">Who can take part?</h3>
      <p>The program is suitable for:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>primary and secondary students</li>
        <li>teachers and wellbeing teams</li>
        <li>whole-school implementations or individual classes</li>
        <li>school leadership looking to strengthen wellbeing culture</li>
      </ul>
      <p>BeKind is designed to be flexible for any Australian school.</p>

      <h3 class="m-t-lg m-b-md">How long does the program run for?</h3>
      <p>
        BeKind is designed to be run over 5 consecutive weeks, focusing on one act of kindness each
        week. However, a school can opt to run it over 10 weeks, focusing on one act of kindness
        over two weeks instead of the one. Teachers are welcome to adjust what time of year/term to
        suit their class or school calendar.
