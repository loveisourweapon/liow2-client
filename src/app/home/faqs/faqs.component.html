      <h3 class="m-t-lg m-b-md">What is the LIOW campaign?</h3>
      <p>
        <b>Love is our Weapon (LIOW)</b> is a bold and creative evangelism initiative that empowers
        churches, ministries, and groups to impact their communities through intentional acts of
        love.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each week, your group focuses on a specific “act of love”, like speaking words of
        encouragement, being generous, or honouring local heroes. You’ll explore the theme through
        preaching, small group discussions, and then go out and put it into action!
      </p>
      <p>
        Your group also gets its own subsite on the LIOW website, where you can track your progress
        in real-time. As people click “done” and share testimonies, your counter climbs, and your
        feed fills with stories of transformation.
      </p>
