      <h4>BeKind is more than a program—it's a movement.</h4>
      <p>
        We exist to inspire students, teachers, and school communities to create positive change
        through simple, intentional acts of kindness.
      </p>
      <p>
        We believe that kindness is powerful. When people choose compassion, respect, and empathy,
        classrooms become safer, communities grow stronger, and students learn to value themselves
        and others.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our vision is to see a generation of young people empowered to make a difference—one kind
        choice at a time. We imagine schools where kindness is normalised, celebrated, and modelled
        at every level; where students feel connected, supported, and motivated to help one another
        thrive.
      </p>
      <p>We see:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>students growing in confidence, empathy, and social responsibility</li>
        <li>classrooms becoming more inclusive and supportive spaces</li>
        <li>schools strengthened by shared purpose and meaningful connection</li>
        <li>communities positively impacted through simple acts of kindness</li>
        <li>lasting change as kindness becomes a habit, not a moment</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        BeKind exists to empower students to positively impact their schools and communities through
        radical acts of kindness, and in doing so, reduce bullying, improve student wellbeing, and
        strengthen positive school culture.
